    <h1>5/30/2024 - Welcome!</h1>
    <h3>Hello, and welcome to my blog! In this blog, I will talk about lots of things, if I ever update it. I know lots of things about computers, and some things about beauty and fashion. I made this blog for a computer science class, and hope to continue with it. I like to think of this blog as a podcast, but on a webpage. My bestie is Alyssa, and we both like Hello Kitty, food, and saying "Howdy!" My favorite foods are Cosmic Brownies, Sour Cream and Onion Pringles, and I drink Sparkling Ice. I like Taylor Swift, and my favorite albums are reputation and Lover. My favorite games are Roblox and Forza Horizon 5. Right now it is 2024. COVID-19 basically ended last year, which was good. There is now the "metaverse" and the Apple Vision Pro, which is very expensive. I am 13 and in 7th grade right now, which makes me sad because there is only 6 days of school left and my bestie is going to high school. I wonder if this blog will be a historical artifact in the future, and I will be part of history. Thanks for reading!</h3>
