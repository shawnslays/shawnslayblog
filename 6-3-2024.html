    <h1>6/3/2024 - Day 2</h1>
    <h3>Hey guys. It's the last week of school now and I won't see my bestie until I get to high school. However, it's going to be fun because this is going to be a fun week. Today's issue is going to be a short one because I'm running out of time to write. Have a good day!</h3>
