    <h1>6/5/2024 - Day 3</h1>
    <h3>There is 3 days let of school, including today. I went to Verizon yesterday to look at phones because my parents might get me one. And guess what, my sister got an iPhone 14 and I got to keep her iPhone 12! I am so happy!. I might be able to set it up with my dad when I get home. I think today is going to be a good day!</h3>
